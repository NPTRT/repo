- Fragmentation might be a problem in data availability because if Celestia goes down, then it's "house of cards"
- Solana managed to solve 1. Transaction fees and 2. Transactions per seconds, which Ethereum hasn't solved yet
- In order to enjoy full decentralization we need to ensure that more nodes are queried and not colluded, to avoid the Byzantine fault
- Kadena is an horizontally scalable monolithic chain / which communicates using chainweb as an infinitely scalable data availability layer 
- Flux uses Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)
- Eclipse is the Ethereum's L2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine
- Parallelized Layer 2: Eclipse SVM L2 takes care of Execution, while at the same time Data Availability is on Celestia and Bridge validation + Settlement on Ethereum
- Daniel Keller from Flux shared about the project and PoUW. Decentralized infrastructure available for 4 years
Crosschain Solutions
 • CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol)
 • Focuses on asset transfers between blockchains by defining a ruleset on how the underlying assets are bridged
 • Ensures secure movement of tokens
 • CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)
 • Broader scope covering overall interoperability between chains
 • Facilitates asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain smart contracts
 • Wormhole
 • A practical platform for cross-chain interoperability using both principles of CCIP/CCTP
 • Enables asset transfers and information sharing between networks


Ethereum Modular Scaling Using Eclipse
 • General discussion on Ethereum's modular scaling strats
 • Introduction of Eclipse as a tool for scaling

Celestia
 • A modular blockchain and data availability layer
 • Separates consensus from execution, enhancing scalability
 • Allows developers to deploy their own rollups
 • Provides security and data availability, but execution is on individual layers

General POW / POS Discussion


Alternative Consensus
 • Proof of Network Participation (PoNP)
 • A consensus algorithm that selects nodes based on the quality of their contributions in validating transactions and adding new blocks
 • Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)
 • A variation PoW that supports 'for hire' computing power for practical, useful tasks beyond just mining
