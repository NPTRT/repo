### Best blockchains for 2024
- How important is decentralization?
- It depends on the application, but somehow there is still a big role for centralized infrastructure
- Awareness of data exploitation and privacy plays a crucial role in the decision making
- Web hosting and data storage ICP
- JAX network started to solve scalability and uses Proof of Work for consensus 
- It's hard to define decentralization, because 10 thousand nodes and 500 thousand nodes are both decentralized
- Similarly it is hard to define scalability, because it depends on what type of solutions are implemented to absorb the load of transactions
- What is measurement after all?  
- Are we striving towards a unified blockchain
- Blockchain finality is important in importing web2 apps to web3 (e.g. Google Maps on web3, decentralized messaging), but for messages to travel fast, speed has to be instantaneous
- What is consensus after all? 
- We can approach blockchain from a tech perspective and wonder what is consensus from a mathematical perspective, but eventually for a big bank to choose a blockchain to work with a private blockchain
- What is scalability after all?
- Scaling a database means to scale it as big as possible at the lowest possible cost, but this is a centralized issue
- Example: TON ordinals and BRC inscriptions on December 7th, 2023
- There is lack of use cases that provide us with clear examples of what could be the shortfalls of blockchain, so we end up measuring quantitative data such as transactions per second and speed, but the intricacies of web3 are much more complicated
- The airdrop on Solana provided a massive adoption towards the blockchain and gathering liquidity
- There is an element of personal preferences where some users are "fans" of a certain blockchain vs another just because they like arbitrary elements of it, like the brand or the community, with no interest in the technology itself
- Hyerpledger Fabric has been very well adopted by Government entities, but these type of blockchains tend not to have traction among crypto native communities
- Some believe that the only significant use of blockchain will be for financial instruments such as crypto currency, but others believe that blockchain has worked as a significant instrument for DAOs and other community driven initiatives, like art and NFT, gaming and entertainment
- Web3 is the way to reward users for their data
- Twitter started rewarding content creators
- What is web3 after all?
- How about monetizing someone's wallet? Does that classify as web3 service?
- DeFi monetizes in web3, but it is identical in terms of concept to traditional finance (e.g. staking = fixed deposit)
- Content creation monetization in web3 is still heavily intermediated by web2 infrastructure
- Data ownership and monetary incentives could be a defining parameter of what is web3
- Stepn and Brave browser are examples of monetary incentives
- Some Government-led initiatives to connect Gov Agencies have been developed in web2 as well as in web3
- The price performance of some tokens builds the case that the blockchain success from tech dev perspective is interconnected (e.g. Solana)
- Final list: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Sui, ICP, Jax, Doge, Bitcoin, Stacks
