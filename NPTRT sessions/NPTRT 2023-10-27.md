### ZK Rollups
- Running a decentralised ZK network is complex
- Centralised sequencer could censor certain types of transactions or actors
- In the centralised sequencer we can't identify who's using the [[Maximal extractable value (MEV)]]
- Standardising the node operations
- Banker example that approved batches of operations
- Why and how can censorship happen under a malicious intention?
- Liquidation transacitons could be censored if the supernode operator has an advantage in doing so
- Supernode operators might have incentives such as bribery in censoring certain transactions
- Proof cannot be altered, but the sequence can stopped
- [[Mempool]] #research #check is where the transactions are stored before the validation
- DAO governance in an centralised supernode could be a solution, but the proof of stake might be needed
- [[Non-transferable Governance Tokens]] are used in Arcade #check  (Twitter user Foobar) #resource 
- MEV bot in the L2 (darkpool flashbot)
- Fraud proof rollup Arbitrum and Optimism
- [[ZK Rollups]] followed in implementation
- Now Single Sequencer ZK moving towards the Decentralised Sequencer
- What if you want to develop a L2 on top to your existing L1 for scaling purpose. The L2 is open source. then the deployer can monitor the actors in the network and identify those who attempt to censor transactions.
- If a problem cannot be solved with cryptography, let's solve it with crypto economics #quote #check 
- BT Algorithm for solving the [[Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)]] problem 
	- solution 1: Create a Governance the the supernode operators are acting in the best interest.
	- solution 2: Use code of the ZK sequence is [[Open Source]] 
	- solution 3: Education on what's a [[Supernode Operator]] #research 
- In wallet programming, in K3S (container based - container runtime) #research using [[eBPF]] the goals is to monitor from booth to execution [[MPC]] key custody
